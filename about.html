              Hey There! I am Vishnu Dut.I am from Chennai, I am 18 yrs old,I have been living in chennai for past 13 years.
              Now coming to School I did my schooling in S.B.O.A school and junior college.I continued my 11th and 12th in the same school.Like
              all students who dreams to take the subject which he wants afte 10th ,I wanted to take the computer science group,but landed up taking biology due to family interest(you know happens in most familes).
              Well to fulfill their wish I suffered a lot by taking bio in my highschool.But anyways after two years of struggle completed my schooling.
              And then comes the biggest part of life COLLEGE. I chose engineering which obviously my parents didn't like.
              After there was a long story for selecting the college, and finally I got into VIT Chennai.</p>

            <p class="about" >
             First day was so exciting and it gave me a good experience.I was a computer science student who doesn't know anything about it.
              After a few months i met one of my childhood friend who studied in the same college.As the days passed learned a lot of new stuff in college got a ton of friends.
              Well when i was thinking what am i going to do further my friend Sriram suggested me to study about web-dev.At first i was really fascinated when i saw the stuff i can do with the web-dev!.It was really cool.
              I was a slow learner though i managed to learn Html,Css,Bootstrap,little bit of Javascript and Jquery.Thanks to my buddy Sriram who helped me to get through all these stuff.</br></p>
              <p class="about">
                Apart from these stuff I am a professional piano player.I have been learning piano for almost 12 years.I have completed till Grade 5 in Trinity college of London. Bored after attempting the Grade
                exams i planned to drop writing those exams and started to learn other stuff and also started making piano cover for songs.Playing  Piano is my stress buster.
                So far one year gone on college it was a great journey till now.Excited to see how my second year is.
